# Current Context

## Current Work Focus
Refactoring completed, ready for testing and deployment

## Recent Changes
Completed comprehensive codebase refactoring including UI component decoupling, enhanced error handling with resource cleanup, improved error recovery mechanisms, GObject signal-based decoupling, interface-based communication, and threading safety improvements. Resolved GObject initialization bugs across multiple UI components (ModelConfigUI, ModeSelectionUI, PromptInputUI, FileManagementUI, StatusProgressUI) discovered during testing. Fixed method signature mismatch error in DreamPrompterEventHandler.on_mode_changed() where direct call lacked required 'mode' parameter.

## Next Steps
Begin testing phase and prepare for deployment
