# Dream Prompter Active Context

## Current Work Focus
Investigating plugin crash that occurs when clicking Generate Image button, despite previous fixes. Added extensive debug logging to identify crash location, suspecting invalid model configurations or API call failures causing silent crashes.

## Recent Changes
- **CRITICAL FIX**: Replaced immediately-closing async dialog with synchronous processing that keeps dialog open during API calls
- Implemented `_sync_generate()` and `_sync_edit()` methods that call ReplicateAPI directly while dialog remains open
- Added proper UI status updates during streaming API responses (progress callbacks work correctly now)
- Removed problematic thread-based async processing that tried to access destroyed UI
- Removed unused test_models.py file

## Next Steps
1. Test plugin to verify crash hixfixed aed UI  orksapnopdI
2. Remove debug logging oncf
3. Plugin now has proper synchronous flow: validation → API call → result display → dialog close

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- **Security First**: Prioritize fixing critical vulnerabilities before feature development
- **Incremental Refactoring**: Break large refactoring tasks into manageable steps
- **Testing Strategy**: Implement tests for critical paths before making changes
- **API Security**: Review and strengthen Replicate API integration security
- **Memory Management**: Address potential memory leaks in image processing operations

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- **Security-by-Design**: Validate all inputs and external data sources
- **Error Resilience**: Provide clear user feedback for all error conditions
- **Modular Design**: Continue breaking down large files into focused components
- **Thread Safety**: Use proper synchronization for shared state access
- **User Experience**: Balance security improvements with usability

## Learnings and Project Insights
- Multiple security vulnerabilities exist that require immediate attention
- Thread safety is compromised in several critical sections
- Code organization has grown organically and needs systematic refactoring
- Error handling patterns are inconsistent across modules
- Type hints coverage varies significantly between modules
- Memory management for large images needs optimization

## Current Development Priorities
1. **CRITICAL**: Security vulnerability remediation
2. **HIGH**: Thread safety and concurrency fixes
3. **MEDIUM**: Code organization and refactoring
4. **MEDIUM**: Error handling standardization
5. **LOW**: Performance optimizations and enhancements
