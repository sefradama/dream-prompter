# Dream Prompter Active Context

## Current Work Focus
Completed comprehensive codebase analysis identifying critical security vulnerabilities, architectural issues, and code quality concerns. The focus now shifts to addressing high-priority issues and implementing systematic improvements.

## Recent Changes
- Comprehensive codebase analysis completed
- Security vulnerabilities documented (URL validation, input sanitization, API key storage)
- Thread safety and concurrency issues identified
- Code organization problems cataloged (monolithic files, repetitive code)
- Detailed issue checklist created for development prioritization

## Next Steps
1. **HIGH PRIORITY**: Fix critical security vulnerabilities (URL validation, input sanitization)
2. Address thread safety issues in dialog threading components
3. Refactor `dialog_gtk.py` (800+ lines) into smaller, focused modules
4. Implement standardized error handling patterns
5. Add comprehensive type hints across codebase
6. Establish unit testing infrastructure

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- **Security First**: Prioritize fixing critical vulnerabilities before feature development
- **Incremental Refactoring**: Break large refactoring tasks into manageable steps
- **Testing Strategy**: Implement tests for critical paths before making changes
- **API Security**: Review and strengthen Replicate API integration security
- **Memory Management**: Address potential memory leaks in image processing operations

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- **Security-by-Design**: Validate all inputs and external data sources
- **Error Resilience**: Provide clear user feedback for all error conditions
- **Modular Design**: Continue breaking down large files into focused components
- **Thread Safety**: Use proper synchronization for shared state access
- **User Experience**: Balance security improvements with usability

## Learnings and Project Insights
- Multiple security vulnerabilities exist that require immediate attention
- Thread safety is compromised in several critical sections
- Code organization has grown organically and needs systematic refactoring
- Error handling patterns are inconsistent across modules
- Type hints coverage varies significantly between modules
- Memory management for large images needs optimization

## Current Development Priorities
1. **CRITICAL**: Security vulnerability remediation
2. **HIGH**: Thread safety and concurrency fixes
3. **MEDIUM**: Code organization and refactoring
4. **MEDIUM**: Error handling standardization
5. **LOW**: Performance optimizations and enhancements
