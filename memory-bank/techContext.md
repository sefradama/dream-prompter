# Dream Prompter Technology Context

## Core Technologies

### Programming Language
- **Python 3.x**: Primary development language
- Object-oriented design patterns
- Standard library utilization
- Third-party package integration

### GUI Framework
- **GTK (GIMP Toolkit)**: Cross-platform GUI toolkit
- PyGObject bindings for Python
- Dialog-based interface design
- Signal and event handling

### Internationalization
- **gettext**: Translation framework
- **PO files**: Portable object files for translations
- **POT files**: Template files for new translations
- Multi-language support (bn, es, fr, hi, ja, ko, pt, ru, zh_CN, zh_TW)

### Development Tools
- **pyproject.toml**: Project configuration and dependency management
- **setuptools**: Package building and distribution
- **Build scripts**: Custom translation and packaging scripts
- **Type stubs**: Static type checking support for GTK libraries

## External Integrations

### GIMP Integration
- **GIMP Python API**: Plugin interface
- **GObject Introspection**: Dynamic language bindings
- Image processing workflow integration
- Plugin installation and management

### AI Platform Integration
- **Replicate API**: AI model hosting platform
- REST API communication
- Model input/output handling
- Authentication and rate limiting

## Development Environment

### Dependencies
- GTK libraries and Python bindings
- GObject introspection tools
- Translation utilities (gettext, msgfmt, xgettext)
- Development dependencies for type checking

### Build System
- Python packaging with pyproject.toml
- Custom build scripts for translations
- Cross-platform compatibility considerations
- Distribution packaging

### Code Quality
- Type hints and stubs for GTK libraries
- Code organization following Python conventions
- Modular design for maintainability
- Documentation in README and supporting files

## Deployment Considerations

### Platform Support
- Linux (primary development platform)
- Cross-platform compatibility through GTK
- GIMP plugin distribution
- Standalone application packaging

### Runtime Requirements
- Python runtime environment
- GTK library dependencies
- System locale support for internationalization
- Network connectivity for API integrations

### Performance Considerations
- Thread-based processing for responsiveness
- Memory management for large prompt collections
- Efficient API communication
- Caching strategies for repeated operations
